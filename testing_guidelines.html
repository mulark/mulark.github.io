<h2>
General Testing Guidelines
</h2>

<h3>Simple rules to follow</h3>
<ul>
<p>
In the majority of cases, the inbuilt benchmarking utility should be used. It can be accessed using the <code>--benchmark</code> command on the Factorio executable.
</p>
<p>
Multiple tests should be conducted for the same map, to minimize the run to run variance.
</p>
<p>
Where applicable running system fans locked to 100% speed may be beneficial. This can reduce the chance of thermal throttling having a different magnitude of effect between maps/runs.
</p>
</ul>






<h4>
Pitfalls and Mitigations
</h4>

<p>
There are a number of measures and potential pitfalls possible when benchmarking any ingame tests. I will outline potential pitfalls and mitigations that can be taken to avoid those pitfalls. When applicable supporting evidence will be included, often in the form of linking to past tests.
