<h2>Is it better to use offshore pumps where they are needed directly in, or use as few as possible and pipe water to the destination?</h2>
<h5>Factorio Version 0.16.51</h5>

<h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
<p> It is better to use offshore pumps at every opportunity pointing straight into the machine.</p>

<h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
<p> For many entities in the game, water is required. By using landfill, we can engineer a factory where it's possible to point a offshore pump directly into one of these inputs. This saves us several pipes, typically 3 or 4 per crafting machine.</p>
<p> However, these offshore pumps could possibly have a greater total UPS cost than the saved pipes.</p>

<h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
<div class="image-embed" style="width:66.6%;overflow:auto;">
<img style="width:25%;float:right" src="images/Example Direct Water.png" title="An example oil refinery with directly sourced water"></img>
<p> For this test I have created a plastic only design that converts raw material into plastic. Plastic is then dumped straight into an infinity chest.</p>
<p> One of the Plastic setups has 20 offshore pumps directly pointing into the required fluid inputs. The other has as few offshores as required, 2 in this case. The refineries have their own water pipe network, and the cracking has the other water pipe network </p>
<p> The offshore reduced paste has: 312 pipes and 2 offshore pumps. The offshore direct paste has: 232 pipes and 20 offshore pumps. This means that each offshore saves roughly 4 pipes each. With better design, this number could be reduced, possibly to as low as in the range of 3-4 (3 would be difficult for recipes that take two fluid ingredients). However, I don't think that results will change significantly compared to that case. </p>
<p> Next we will need to scale up the number of these pastes until we reach roughly 60 UPS. Putting 200 pastes of each yielded approximately 90 UPS in game, which I believe is close enough to accurately determine which design method is better. </p>

<h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
<img src="images/Offshores_graphic.png"></img>
<p> In a test where each map was benchmarked for 100000 ticks, and benchmarked for that duration 3 times, the design using the maximum number of offshore pumps achieved ~109 UPS, where as the design that used as few offshore pumps as required achieved ~98 UPS. </p>
<p> This means that using offshore pumps directly in to fluid inputs should beat piping water. It is not possible to test every design, but there is a good degree of certainty that no design that pipes water beats one that directly inputs it. </p>
<p> The full raw csv data is available at <a href="raw-data/test-000003.csv">here.</a> </p>


<h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
<p> In the future, all fluid designs should input water directly to the appropriate spot.</p>
<p> It's possible, although unlikely, for a different design to have a different result. If you have a different or novel design that you believe could contradict this result, please create an issue on the github.</p>
