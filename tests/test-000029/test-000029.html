<h2>test-000029 : What is the performance cost of a moving ore belt in front of miners?</h2>
<h5>Factorio Version 1.1.90</h5>


<h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
<p>
<s>Sideload miners if they are outputting onto a belt alongside other miners</s>
Warning: the results here were tested immediately after cloning the designs.
The transport lines require running for a bit to merge and stabilize, so the results
here are not to be trusted.
This article will be updated with new data.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
<p>
When mining directly to a belt, is there a performance cost to have multiple idle
miners unable to output to the same belt? Could such a performance penalty if it
exists be mitigated by using splitters? Belts are multi-threaded, so in theory,
avoiding additional checks on the miners would result in a net positive effect
on performance.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
<p>
This test consists of 4 otherwise equivalent designs, each of which produce a full
blue belt of iron ore. Mining productivity is high enough that only a single 
miner is needed to saturate a half belt, only 2 miners per belt are active.
All belts eventually terminate with a single loader into an infinity chest set
to void items.
</p>
<p>

<p>
The first design just runs a belt past each miner. This is the simple option
<p>
The next designs have each pair of two miners mine to a dedicated belt, and then
these belts are merged together prior to the infinity chest.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/splitters_best.png"/>
<p>
The two variants of this are the theorized best and worst case scenarios.
In the first variant, the splitter closest to the infinity chest prioritizes the
input side that has no other splitters on the belt prior to itself. This pattern
repeats for every splitter, each prioritizing the side with a direct pair of miners
attached.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/splitters_worst.png"/>
<p>
The second variant is the theorized worst case scenario. This prioritizes the
splitters such that moving flow of items must pass through every splitter.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/sideload.png"/>
<p>
In the Technical Factorio discord, it was suggested to try side loading as well,
so this fourth design is a simple line of belts where each miner mines to a small
belt stub that side loads onto the main belt line.
<p>
All 4 of these designs were copied individually to a scale that would rival the
largest megabases (roughly the ore requirement of a 50K SPM megabase).
Each design was saved in a map and then each of the three maps was benchmarked
using the inbuilt Factorio benchmark for 3 times at 1000 ticks.
Care was taken to put each design in the same starting position before cloning
to minimize the chance of performance effects due to chunk positioning


<h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
<p>
    <img src="images/results.svg"></img>
    <ul>
    <li>Testing results shows that the sideloading and splitter best case configuration
		performed about the same.
	<li> The splitter worst case lost around 7% performance compared to the others
	<li> The simple case was by far the worst, having several times worse performance.
		It's clear it's not a good option for the largest of megabases.
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    All maps will be uploaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rZo0oa4lQGdYYXyEbUnS0Cd8MD8DPpxf"> here.</a>
</p>


<h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
<p>
If striving to keep belts full for longer by having more than one miner per belt,
care should be taken to keep the miners from checking for available space in front
of them. Sideloading appears to be the best of the options tested here for that purpose.
