<h2>test-000029 : What is the performance cost of a moving ore belt in front of miners?</h2>
<h5>Factorio Version 1.1.90 + 1.1.91</h5>


<h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
<p>
All options to isolate miners from having moving belts in front of them appear to be beneficial.
It's not clear there's an ultimate winner, but both side loading and splitters can be competitive.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
<p>
When mining directly to a belt, is there a performance cost to have multiple idle
miners unable to output to the same belt? Could such a performance penalty if it
exists be mitigated by using splitters? Belts are multi-threaded, so in theory,
avoiding additional checks on the miners would result in a net positive effect
on performance.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
<p>
This test consists of 4 otherwise equivalent designs, each of which produce a full
blue belt of iron ore. Mining productivity is high enough that only a single 
miner is needed to saturate a half belt, only 2 miners per belt are active.
All belts eventually terminate with a single loader into an infinity chest set
to void items.
</p>
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/simple.png"/>
<p>
The first design just runs a belt past each miner. This is the simple option
<p>
The next designs have each pair of two miners mine to a dedicated belt, and then
these belts are merged together prior to the infinity chest.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/splitters_best.png"/>
<p>
The two variants of this are the theorized best and worst case scenarios.
In the first variant, the splitter closest to the infinity chest prioritizes the
input side that has no other splitters on the belt prior to itself. This pattern
repeats for every splitter, each prioritizing the side with a direct pair of miners
attached.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/splitters_worst.png"/>
<p>
The second variant is the theorized worst case scenario. This prioritizes the
splitters such that moving flow of items must pass through every splitter.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/sideload.png"/>
<p>
In the Technical Factorio discord, it was suggested to try side loading as well,
so this fourth design is a simple line of belts where each miner mines to a small
belt stub that side loads onto the main belt line.
<p>
All 4 of these designs were copied individually to a scale that would rival the
largest megabases (roughly the ore requirement of a 50K SPM megabase).
Each design was saved in a map and then each of the three maps was benchmarked
using the inbuilt Factorio benchmark for 3 times at 1000 ticks.
Care was taken to put each design in the same starting position before cloning
to minimize the chance of performance effects due to chunk positioning

<h3>Corrections and Updates</h3>
<p>
The prior sections were as the test was originally written. During further
investigations, a couple of errors and additional scenarios were suggested
to attempt.
<p>
The issues with the previous results were that the maps were cloned from a steady
state design, but even still, transport lines require some warmup period before
they settle into their final configuration. This update runs each map after cloning
to let the transport lines stabilize.
<p>
In addition to that correction, a few new designs were put forward
<p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/splitters_coalesce.png"/>
<p>
The first of these designs features a coalescing arrangement of splitters. This
design allows any combination of inputs that yeild one full belt of material to
output one full belt of material.
<p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/sideload_compact.png"/>
<p>
The next design was to compact the sideloading configuration. I initially did
this because I thought that there were transport line splits being introduced
due to the uneven spacing of the side loads, but that ended up being not the case.
Thus, there should be neligible difference between this and the prior sideloading
option tested here.
<p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/sideload_combined.png"/>
<p>
Another concept to test was to halve the number of sideloading points by combining
the output of two miners into one belt that sideloads onto the "main" belt.
This wouldn't be fully optimal once those side belts start being used (as one
of the two miners would then have a moving belt in front of it), but this
lets us test if the concept is worth exploring further.
<p>
<img style="width: 20%" src="images/splitters_worst_add_isolation.png"/>
<p>
One observation made for the splitter_worst configuration was that on the final
splitter in the chain, the input side without priority continuously flickered
blue in show-transport-lines debug. (This was true for every design that used
splitters, but only splitter_worst had this flickering travel all the way back up
to the miners. The other designs only had 1 tile of length of flickering before
the next splitter). To test this, I added a temporary red wire to a belt before
the splitter, and removed the default circuit conditions from it. Then I removed the red wire.
Because the belt piece didn't have the default condition anymore, it inserted an
additional split in the transport line.

<p>

<h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
<p>
    <img src="images/results.svg"></img>
    <ul>
    <li>Testing results showed that the splitter_best won.
	<li>It's a bit surprising that splitter_best and splitter_coalesce are so far apart,
		since both have only a single active splitter. coalesce does have two additional
		sideload "candidates", which might explain the difference.
	<li>The three sideload cases show marginal difference between them. There does seem
		to be a benefit to reducing the number of sideload points, but it seems unlikely
		that going from 6 -> 2 sideloads (theoretical best on the active line) will have
		a larger improvement than 12 -> 6 did. Thus it would still fall behind
		the best case splitter option.
	<li>Compact may be slightly faster than the default sideload option due to 
		the fact it's having to interact with fewer ore resource entities, so may
		be slightly better cached.
		The differece is incredibly marginal though. And if the intent is to fully
		mine a patch, the overlapping mining areas will lead to more miners needed, and thus
		likely be worse overall.
	<li>The simple case was by far the worst, having several times worse performance than any other option.
	<li>It's surprising that adding isolation to the line that was flickering active
		had a negative if anything performance effect.
	<li>The advantage the coalescing case has (that it can produce a full belt whenever
		the input meets a full belt) might be worth the hit at lower mining productivities.
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Further Explorations</h3>
<p>
In looking at the above data, I got interested to see how the performance changes
over time as miners deplete. This will be explored under the assumption that a
miner always produces a full lane until the moment it is depleted.
<p>
As to reduce the number of permutations, I will remove a few maps from further
consideration. The simple option performs very badly initially, so no reason
to continue using it. The splitter_worst options aren't that interesting, since
splitter_best is better initially, and we will still be able to see if it degrades
to the level of splitter_worst.
The number of sideload options will just be reduced to the single, base, sideload option.
<p>
To test depletion, I modified the ore amounts to 1 under each pairing of miners
based on when the first miner pairing would deplete. The command
<p>
<code>
/c top=-66 bot=(top + 5) for i, ent in pairs(game.player.surface.find_entities_filtered{type="resource"}) do if ent.position.y > top and ent.position.y < bot then ent.amount=1 end end
</code>
<p>
was tailored for each map to deplete the first, second, etc. pairs of miners
<p>

<h3>The Data...2</h3>
<p>
<img style="width:100%" src="images/deplete.svg">

<ul>
	<li>Scaling shows that sideloading gets better as the mine depletes,
		but the splitter based solutions get worse as depletion occurs.
	<li>Depending on the density of ore under the miners that go first or last,
		splitters or sideloading could win. Each miner pair runs for 1/7th (Nth)
		the time if ore is evenly distributed, which doesn't happen with real
		ore generation.
</ul>

<p>
To take this line of reasoning to its logicial conclusion, I created two more maps
at the "nano" scale. They consist of 4 miners, and joining is handled by a single
splitter or by sideloading the ore.
<p>
<img style="width:100%" src="images/nano.svg">
<p>
At this point, the differences if there are any have entirely evaporated. Either option
is just as good as another.
<p>
If there was a design based on sideloading where each active belt is only aware
of 1 sideload per lane per depleted miner, it's possible that could maintain excellent
performance.
<p>
<img style="width:20%" src="images/chained_sideload_idea.png">
<p>
The picture shows the idea best. As long as the rightmost miner has ore, it's
only aware of one sideload. Once that depletes, only two and so on. I couldn't
come up with a way to fit this tiled 7 miners deep like was done for the other
tests. And at some point I need finish one test before it becomes a run on sentence.
I'll continue to investigate and possibly create another test if I find something
good.

</p>


<h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
<p>
If striving to keep belts full for longer by having more than one miner per belt,
care should be taken to keep the miners from checking for available space in front
of them. Most or all options appear to be good options, as long as the only miner
with ore moving in front of it is the one doing the mining.
Sideloading might have the slight edge, but it's definitely not clear cut better
one way or another.
