    <h2>test-000031 : Is it better to have two miners each mine a half lane,
        or have one miner mine into a splitter for a full belt?</h2>
    <h5>Factorio Version 1.1.91</h5>


    <h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to mine directly into a splitter and then sideload the two
        ore streams into one full belt. It is not known if that performs better, worse,
        or the same as just using 2 miners to fill the belt.
    </p>

    <h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
    <p>
        The test consists of otherwise identical designs cloned to a large amount
        of production (roughly the amount of ore needed for 50k SPM).
        A few variations of each design are posed to further refine the hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mining productivity was set high enough that a single miner could sustain
        a full blue belt worth of output, but not excessively higher than that level.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first of these designs is a simple 2 miner setup

    <p>
        Two miners, with one normal belt before the underground belt
    </p>
    <p>
        The expectation of adding underground belts is to force the belt insertion
        transport line lookup closer to the point of insertion. One of these puts
        underground belts right at the miner, and one adds an additional space before
        the underground. It was observed that by having the underground right at
        the miner, the wakeup list debug visualization would flicker as the miner
        operated.

    </p>
    <p>
        The competing designs and variants are mining straight into a splitter. One
        variant is to add an underground belt to force the transport line lookup
        point sooner. This comes with two options, since it looks like the closest
        possible underground position results in the wakeup list debug visualization
        flickering. Another variant adds input priority to the near side
        of the miner, and the final variant adds output priority to the splitter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each design was saved in a map and then each of the maps was benchmarked
        using the inbuilt Factorio benchmark 3 times at 1000 ticks each.
        Care was taken to put each design in the same starting position before cloning
        to minimize the chance of performance effects due to chunk positioning.

    <h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
    <p>
        <img src="images/results.svg"></img>
    <ul>
        <li>Variants that result in the miner wakeup list visualization flickering
            should be avoided, since they are strictly worse than their spaced counterparts
        <li>Mining into a splitter is better than using 2 miners to achieve the
            same thing.
        <li>Output priority on the splitter should be avoided. Input priority is down to
            measurement tolerance, so shouldn't matter either way.
        <li>Using underground belts showed a benefit for the 2 miners configuration,
            but a penalty for the splitter based configuration. That would suggest
            that the item insertion point lookup doesn't exist for sideloaded belts,
            which does in fact make sense.
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
    <p>
        When producing/consuming a full blue belt, use a single miner mining into
        a splitter to achieve the best performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are additional factors not accounted for which might affect these results.
        One: what happens at much higher mining productivity levels (ie. far more than
        necessary to saturate a blue belt). Two: does this performance profile
        hold true when a belt is not fully utilized? There are possibly more factors
        not being thought of as well.
