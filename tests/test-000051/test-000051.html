<h2>test-000051 : Retesting the UPS cost of diagonal trains; Is it worth going diagonal to avoid ore?</h2>
<h5>Factorio Version 0.18.24</h5>

<h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
<p>
    Diagonal trains still perform worse than their straight counterparts.
    It was also determined that diverting to avoid ore patches is a worthwhile
    optimization, albeit at a smaller gain than avoiding diagonals.
</p>
<p>
    Unexpectedly, the northern direction of travel no longer seems to be advantageous
    to travel in. Previously a 7% difference was observed, now it was measured at 0.5%.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
<p>
    Previously, we explored the UPS cost of diagonal trains in
    <a href="/tests/test-000026/test-000026.html">test-000026</a>. In that test,
    we found that diagonal trains were worse UPS wise even when accounting for
    their shorter path.
</p>
<p>
    As a recap, diagonal trains have their AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) rest
    on either 9 or 12 advanced tiles. As the train moves, it has to check that
    many advanced tiles to potentially collide with anything in them.
</p>
<p>
    Added sometime after 0.16.51, the <code>show-selected-entity-advanced-tiles</code>
    debug option found in the F4 menu allows for easy visualization of the
    advanced tiles occupied by an entity at any one time. The figure below shows
    the 12 advanced tiles that are presently occupied. Depending on the precise
    position of the locomotive along the rail, either 9 or 12 advanced tiles
    will be occupied at any one time.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
    This is in contrast to straight locomotives, where only 3 or 4 advanced
    tiles are occupied at the same time.

<p>
    Compared to the last time we tested this, a number of factors might have
    changed the results. These are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li> Factorio Version. We last tested this in Factorio Version 0.16.51.
            That was quite a while ago as we are currently on 0.18.24. We need
            to update the results in case and optimizations or behavior changed
            in the meantime.
        <li> Methodology. In the previous test we failed to account for other
            obstaces that may be along the path in the way. By far the main
            example of this is ore patches. This test needs to explore if diagonal
            travel to avoid driving over an ore patch is a worthwhile tradeoff.
    </ul>
</p>


<h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
<p>
    This time around, a new test map has been generated with the following settings
</p>
<figure>
    <img style="width:40%" src="images/ResourceSettings.png"></img>
    <figcaption>The map generation settings used.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    By including ore, we can more effectively test avoiding patches along the path.
</p>
<p>
    We quickly set up 4 possible paths for a train to travel. Due to random chance,
    not all paths have identical amounts of ore underneath. If the results are close,
    we should take results with a healthy amount of salt.
</p>

        2: Straight rails, avoiding ore.
        <br>
        3: Diagonal rails, direct path.
        <br>
        4: Diagonal rails, avoiding ore.
        <br>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    In the interest of simplifying the test, we instead swap out the multiple
    train setup of the previous test for 1 really long train. The train has 102
    locomotives and 206 cargo wagons.
</p>
<p>
    Matching to the paths above:
    <ol>
        <li>
            4930 ticks
        <li>
            4910 ticks
        <li>
            4063 ticks
        <li>
            4150 ticks
    </ol>
<p>
    Note that a significant portion of the time is spent leaving/arriving to the
    station portion of the journey. These portions are identical between contenders,
    but it does mean we can't actually use the sqrt(2) rule directly when comparing
    results.
</p>
<p>
    In this test, we will also revist the maps tested previously, testing for
    the same tick durations specified there.
</p>
<p>
    All maps will be ran 10 times, and the best performing tick per run per tick
    will be taken as the "idealized" measurement.
</p>
<p>
    The saves for this test are available with factorio-benchmark-helper.

<h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
<p>
    First, let's take a look at the 4 paths on the new map.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="images/MinWholeUpdatePerTick.svg"></img>
</p>
<p>
    Visually, it looks like the straight rails have a clear advantage.
</p>
<p>
    Next, taking a look at the sum of the previous graph, we can see that
    straight rails took significantly less time to update. But this is not a
    perfect metric, as it ignores the time in ticks it took for the train's journey.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="images/SumMinWholeUpdatePerTick.svg"></img>
</p>
<p>
    To account for the journey, we can multiply the time taken in ms by the
    number of ticks needed to achieve that journey. We can call these "Points",
    and fewer is better.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="images/Points.svg"></img>
</p>
<p>
    When accounting for the longer travel duration, we still see that the straight
    paths clearly beat the diagonal ones. Additionally, it's clear that diverting
    to avoid ore is advantageous.
</p>
<p>
    Moving gears to the maps from test-000026, we start off with the min(wholeUpdate)
    per tick once again.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="images/OldMapPerTick.svg"></img>
</p>
<p>
    Then, looking at the sum time taken by the previous ticks.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="images/OldMapSum.svg"></img>
</p>
<p>
    We can see that the straight case took ~1/2 the time to update from beginning
    to end. The straight rails took 40% more ticks to achieve that, but it's
    improbable that scaling up the straight rail case by 40% would result in 100%
    more performance cost.
</p>
<p>
    One thing of curiosity is that there no longer seems to be an advantage for
    the north (orientation 0) case. The train travelling northeast was 0.5% faster
    than the southwest one, well within the margin of error.
</p>

<h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
<p>
    Diagonal trains have a greater cost than their straight railed counterparts.
    They should be avoided where possible.
</p>
<p>
    Avoiding ore patches is ideal, but it should be done with straight rails as
    much as possible. It's possible that some edge cases might result in superior
    performance to go diagonal to avoid ore patches. But those ought to be
    extreme edge cases.
</p>
<p>
    The northern direction no longer appears to have a significant advantage
    compared to the other cardinal directions.
