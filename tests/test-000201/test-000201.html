<h2>test-000201 : What is the ideal amount of logistic bots in a network?</h2>
<h5>Factorio Version 0.17.79</h5>


<h3 id="The-TLDR"> The TLDR </h3>
<p>
    Using the lowest possible amount of bots in the network, while maintaining
    full production, results in the best performance.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Question"> The Question </h3>
<p>
    In this test we try and find out if there is a performance penalty for
    having too many or too few logistic bots in a bot network, and if there is,
    find out the ideal amount.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Test"> The Test </h3>
<p>
    For this test, we set up a bot build that is rotationally symmetrical to
    ensure efficient bot travel, while still having a reasonably high count of
    active bots (around 300). The build produces iron chests from iron ore.
    Furthermore, recipes are clocked in a way that each quadrant outputs with
    its own offset, to ensure that bot usage remains as constant as possible
    throughout the runs.
</p>
<p>
    Next, we set up the build with the lowest amount of bots possible that
    ensures full production sustained for a long period of time (1h). Through
    trial and error, this number resulted in 403 total bots.
</p>
<p>
    At this minimum number of bots, it appears that the full 403 bots get used.
    But as bots are additionally added, the apparent number of active bots in
    use decreases. By measuring the number of active bots in a cell with a large
    bot excess, the number of bots in use appears to be ~310.
    <a href="raw-data/bot_measurement_bp.txt">(Blueprint)</a>
</p>
<p>
    Using this ~310 number as the baseline, the lowest number of bots
    effectively becomes a factor of 130%. Continuing with linear percentage
    increases, we also test (130%), 135%, 140%, 150%, 200% and 1000% of that
    310 number. These percentages correspond to bot networks with logistic bot
    counts of (403), 418, 434, 465, 610, and 3100 respectively.
</p>
<p>
    Benchmarks were conducted using the inbuilt Factorio benchmarking utility.
    Each map was benchmarked 30 times, for 720 ticks each.
</p>

<h3 id="The-Data"> The Data </h3>
<p>
    <img src="images/benchmark results.png"></img>
</p>
<p>
    The data paints a clear picture: each increment of bots on top of the lowest
    possible amount results in a degradation of performance. Most notably, the
    biggest difference between two consecutive saves is the one between the
    lowest possible, and its neighbor with just a 30 bot increment.
</p>
<p>
    If we simply look at the amount of active bots in each save, these results
    seem counterintuitive since the save with the lowest amount of bots in the
    network has the highest amount of active bots, while the save with the most
    bots in the network (1000%) has the lowest amount of active bots.
</p>
<p>
    To further analyze these results, we do a sleepy profile on the saves with
    the lowest amount of bots in the network and the save with 150% bots
    relative to the normal amount of active bots. The results were the
    following:
</p>
<div>
    <table>
      <tr>
          <th> Function </th>
          <th> lowest </th>
          <th> 150% </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logisticNetwork::findBestAvailableRobot </td>
        <td> 1.02s </td>
        <td> 3.61s </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logisticCell::spawnRobot </td>
        <td> 0.05s </td>
        <td> 0.53s </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logisticNetwork::fillRequesters </td>
        <td> 2.85s </td>
        <td> 5.35s </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logisticRobot::update </td>
        <td> 4.29s </td>
        <td> 3.86s </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> logisticRobot::moveToStationingLogic </td>
        <td> 0.49s </td>
        <td> 2.27s </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>
    The function <b>logisticRobot::moveToStationingLogic</b> is responsible for the
    process of bots docking, entering a roboport and becoming idle. Usage here
    is minimal in lowest because bots in this save tend not to dock, they
    instead recharge and continue fulfilling jobs.
</p>
<p>
    The biggest difference lies in <b>logisticNetwork::findBestAvailableRobot</b>.
    Examining its child call <b>logisticCell::spawnRobot</b>, we learn that the cost of
    de-spawning and spawning bots is significant. On top of that, we see from
    <b>logisticNetwork::fillRequesters</b> that when looking for a bot to fulfill a
    request it is significantly faster to pick one that is already in the air
    than it is to look through the roboports and find an idle bot.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, <b>logisticRobot::update</b> confirms that the save with the lowest
    possible amount of bots has the highest amount of active bots, but this
    higher cost is completely offset by the cost of repetitive spawning and
    de-spawning bots (docking).
</p>

<h3 id="Closing"> Closing </h3>
<p>
    On a logistic bot network, reducing the amount of bots to the point where
    they avoid docking, but still maintaining full production results in the
    best performance.
